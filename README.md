# reveal-slides
This is the template that I use for creating presentations with 
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). It simply uses 
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for managing the dependencies offline and a single
html file with the content of the presentation. Thus, in order to use this
template download it and run `npm install`:

```bash
# clone or download the repository
git clone https://github.com/msrocka/reveal-slides.git

# download the depenedencies
cd reveal-slides
npm install
```

After this, just open and edit the `index.html` file ...
